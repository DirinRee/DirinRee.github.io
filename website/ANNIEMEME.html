<h3 id="">Dragon Ball Z</h3>
<p>Dragon Ball Z (Japanese: ドラゴンボールZ ゼット Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. Dragon Ball Z is the sequel to the Dragon Ball anime and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama, that were published from 1988 to 1995 in Weekly Shōnen Jump. Dragon Ball Z first aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 26, 1989 to January 31, 1996, before being dubbed in several territories around the world, including the United States, Australia, Europe, India, and Latin America.

Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku who, along with his companions, defends the Earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and nearly indestructible creatures. While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from his childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his sons, Gohan and Goten, as well as the evolution of his rivals Piccolo and Vegeta from enemies into allies.

Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters comprising its story were initially released by Viz Media under the title Dragon Ball Z. Additional works called animanga were released, which adapt the animation to manga form. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball universe; including 17 movies and 148 video games, many of them being only released in Japan, and a host of soundtracks stemming from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through numerous adaptations, including a more-recent remastered broadcast titled Dragon Ball Kai[a]. There have also been two sequel series; Dragon Ball GT (1996–1997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015–present).

Dragon Ball Z picks up five years after the end of the Dragon Ball anime, with Son Goku as a young adult and father to his son Gohan. A humanoid alien named Raditz arrives on Earth in a spacecraft and tracks down Goku, revealing to him that he is his long-lost big brother and that they are members of a nearly extinct extraterrestrial race called the Saiyans (サイヤ人 Saiya-jin). The Saiyans had sent Goku (originally named "Kakarrot") to Earth as an infant to conquer the planet for them, but he suffered a traumatic brain injury soon after his arrival and lost all memory of his mission, as well as his blood-thirsty Saiyan nature. Goku refuses to help Raditz continue the mission, which results in Raditz kidnapping Gohan. Goku decides to team up with his former enemy Piccolo in order to defeat Raditz and save his son, while sacrificing his own life in the process. In the afterlife, Goku trains under Kaiō-sama until he is revived by the Dragon Balls a year later in order to save the Earth from Raditz' comrades; Nappa and the Saiyan prince Vegeta. During the battle Piccolo is killed, along with Goku's allies Yamcha, Tenshinhan and Chaozu, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist because of Piccolo's death. Goku arrives at the battlefield late, but avenges his fallen friends by defeating Nappa with his new level of power. Vegeta himself enters into the battle with Goku and after numerous clashes, Goku manages to defeat him as well, with the help of Gohan and his best friend Krillin. At Goku's request, they spare Vegeta's life and allow him to escape Earth. During the battle, Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set of Dragon Balls from Piccolo's home planet Namek (ナメック星 Namekku-sei). While Goku recovers from his injuries at the hospital, Gohan, Krillin and Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek in order to use these Dragon Balls to revive their dead friends. However, they discover that Vegeta's superior, the galactic tyrant Lord Frieza, is already there, seeking the Dragon Balls to be granted eternal life. A fully healed Vegeta arrives on Namek as well, seeking the Dragon Balls for himself, which leads to several battles between him and Frieza's henchmen. Realizing he is overpowered, Vegeta teams up with Gohan and Krillin to fight the Ginyu Force, a team of mercenaries summoned by Frieza. After Goku finally arrives on Namek, the epic battle with Frieza himself comes to a close when Goku transforms into a fabled Super Saiyan (超サイヤ人 Sūpā Saiya-jin) and defeats him.

Upon his return to Earth a year later, Goku encounters a time traveler named Trunks, the future son of Bulma and Vegeta, who warns Goku that two Artificial Humans (人造人間 Jinzōningen, lit. "Artificial Humans") will appear three years later, seeking revenge against Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child. During this time, an evil life form called Cell emerges and after absorbing two of the Artificial Humans to achieve his "perfect form," holds his own fighting tournament to decide the fate of the Earth, called the "Cell Games". After Goku sacrifices his own life a second time, to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by defeating Cell after ascending to the second level of Super Saiyan. Seven years later Goku, who has been briefly revived for one day and meets his youngest son Goten, and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Kaioshin against a magical being named Majin Buu. After numerous battles resulting in the destruction and recreation of the Earth, Goku (whose life is permanently restored by the Elder Kaioshin) destroys Majin Buu with a Genki Dama attack containing the energy of everyone on Earth. Goku makes a wish for Buu to be reincarnated as a good person and ten years later, at another martial arts tournament, Goku meets Buu's human reincarnation, Uub. Leaving the match between them unfinished, Goku departs with Uub to train him to become Earth's new defender.

<h3 id="">Dragon Ball Super</h3>
<p>Dragon Ball Super (Japanese: ドラゴンボール超スーパー Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Sūpā) is an ongoing Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation that began airing on July 5, 2015.[8] Its overall plot outline is written by Dragon Ball franchise creator Akira Toriyama, while the individual episodes are written by different screenwriters. It is also a manga series illustrated by Toyotarou, serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine V Jump. The anime is a sequel to Toriyama's original Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z television series featuring the first new storyline in 18 years. It is broadcast on Sundays at 9:00 a.m. on Fuji TV.[4]

Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga.

Plot[edit]
Main article: List of Dragon Ball Super episodes
Four years after the defeat of Majin Buu, peace has returned to Earth. Son Goku has settled down and now works as a radish farmer to support his family. His family and friends live peaceful lives.[9] However, a new threat appears in the form of Beerus, the God of Destruction, who is considered to be the most terrifying being in Universe 7. After awakening from several years of slumber, Beerus is eager to fight the legendary warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy known as the Super Saiyan God (超スーパーサイヤ人ゴッド Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo).[10] To protect Earth, Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God to fight Beerus. Despite losing, Goku's efforts appease the God of Destruction enough that he decides to spare the planet. This part of the series retells the events of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods.

While Goku and Vegeta leave with Beerus and his aide Whis to train for a year, two remnants of Frieza's army arrive at Earth and use the Dragon Balls to revive him. Frieza gathers his forces and returns to enact his revenge on Goku and his friends. Despite getting strong enough to attain a new transformation, he is once again defeated by Goku. This part of the series retells the events of Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'.

On a later occasion, Champa, Beerus' twin brother and the God of Destruction of Universe 6, convinces Beerus to hold a tournament between the best fighters from each god's universe for the possession of Earth. Goku and some of his friends join the tournament, which ends in a surprising victory for Beerus' team after the strongest fighters from each side, Goku and Universe 6's Hit, end up forfeiting. In the occasion, Goku meets and befriends Zenō, the king of all universes. He promises to bring him a friend to play with.

After the tournament is completed, Future Trunks reappears and brings news of a new and powerful enemy resembling Goku that is known as Goku Black. Goku and the others eventually discover that Goku Black is actually a Kaiō-shin from Universe 10 named Zamasu, who hijacked Goku's body from a different timeline as part of his plan to attain immortality and wipe out all mortals.[11] In the end, Zamasu is erased along with the entire future timeline by Zenō from the future, who accompanies Goku back to his timeline. Goku fulfills his promise to Zenō by introducing him to his future self.

Some time after Future Trunks returns home, Zenō and Future Zenō hold a new tournament called the Tournament of Power (力の大会 Chikara no Taikai). The multiverse tournament features teams of fighters from each universe by Goku's suggestion. However, it becomes a battle for survival when both kings declare that the universes defeated at the tournament will be erased.[12] Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Krillin, Android 17, Android 18, Piccolo, Tien, Master Roshi, and a temporarily revived Frieza join the tournament as representatives for Universe 7 to protect it. Despite the fact that Zenō and Future Zenō already have the intention to destroy the weaker universes, most of the fighters from the other universes who are unaware of it view Goku as a villain for suggesting to hold the tournament in the first place.[13] Out of the twelve universes, only four (universe 1, 5, 8, and 12) are exempt from participating due to their inhabitants having an average mortal rank above 7.

Production[edit]
In addition to his role as series creator, Akira Toriyama is also credited for the "original story and character design concepts" of the new anime originally directed by Kimitoshi Chioka.[4] Toriyama elaborated on his involvement with the "Future Trunks arc" saying he created the story based on suggestions from the editorial department, "As with last time, I wrote the overall plot outline, and the scriptwriters have been compiling and expanded the story content into individual episodes, making various changes and additions, and generally doing their best to make the story more interesting."[14] In addition to new characters designed by Toriyama, other characters for the "Universe Survival arc" were designed by Toyotarou, artist of the anime's manga adaptation, and a few by both.[15]

Toei Animation producer Atsushi Kido previously worked on Dragon Ball Z for a brief time during the Freeza arc, while Fuji TV producer Osamu Nozaki said he has been a fan of the series since childhood.[16] Morio Hatano, series director of Saint Seiya Omega (episodes #1–51), began sharing the series director credit with Chioka beginning with episode #33, before taking it over completely with #47. From episode #68 to #76, Morio Hatano shared the role of series director with Kōhei Hatano (no relation), another storyboard artist and episode director for the series.

Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Son Goku, Son Gohan, and Son Goten.[4] Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well.[11][17] However, Jōji Yanami's roles as Kaiō-sama and the narrator were indefinitely taken over by Naoki Tatsuta as of episode 12, so that Yanami could take medical leave.[18] Kōichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also return as Beerus and Whis, respectively.[17]

The first preview of the series aired on June 14, 2015, following episode 157 of Dragon Ball Kai.[19] The next day, the main promotional image for Dragon Ball Super was added to its official website and unveiled two new characters,[17] who were later revealed to be named Champa and Vados, respectively.[20] A thirty-second trailer including the new characters was uploaded to the series' official website on June 26, 2015.[21]

<h3 id="">One Punch Man</h3>
<p>One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン Hepburn: Wanpanman) is an ongoing Japanese superhero parody webcomic created by an author using the pseudonym One[4] which began publication in early 2009.[5] The series quickly went viral, surpassing 7.9 million hits in June 2012.[6] The Japanese shortened name Wanpanman is a play on the long-running children's character Anpanman,[7] wanpan being a contraction of wanpanchi ("one punch").[8] One-Punch Man tells the story of Saitama, an extremely overpowered superhero, who has grown bored by the absence of challenge in his fight against evil and seeks to find a worthy opponent.

A digital manga remake of the series, illustrated by Yusuke Murata, began publication on Shueisha's Young Jump Web Comics website in 2012.[5] The chapters are periodically collected and printed into tankōbon volumes, with twelve released as of December 2, 2016. Viz Media has licensed the remake for English serialization in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine.[9]

An anime television adaptation by Madhouse aired in Japan between October and December 2015.[10][11][12] It was dubbed in English during the summer of 2016, and later that year a planned second season was announced.[13]See also: List of One-Punch Man characters
On an unnamed Earth-like super-continent planet, strange monsters and supervillains have been mysteriously appearing and causing disasters. To combat them, the world's heroes have risen to fight them. Saitama is one such hero, hailing from the metropolis of Z-City and easily defeating monsters and villains with a single punch. However, he has become bored with his superhuman power and only gets truly excited when fighting strong opponents that can challenge him. Over the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, supervillains, and monsters. He gains a disciple in the form of the cyborg Genos and eventually joins the Hero Association in order to gain official recognition. He smashes an incoming meteor, defeats boss villains like the Deep Sea King. When the alien Dark Matter Thieves invade and destroy City A, Saitama defeats their leader Lord Boros using a serious punch.

Saitama gets to know other super heroes in the group, becoming friends with old martial artist Bang and a superhero named King who is actually a cowardly nonviolent otaku. When the Hero Association executive Sitch tries to recruit villains to become superheroes, a villain named Garo emerges and starts beating down many of the other heroes, prompting the association to make a small effort to stop him. In order to learn more about martial arts, Saitama enters a tournament. More ferocious monsters start showing up in the various cities, wearing down many of the heroes. A group of them kidnap an Association sponsor's son. The Hero Association learns that that the monsters have organized into a Monster Association, and that they are also recruiting members by having fighters and others ingest monster cells that transform them into monsters that have far more power.

Over the interwining course of Garo and the Hero Association, it is discovered that the monsters have made their headquarters in the abandoned area of Z-City, which happens to be inhabited by Saitama alone. Garo encounters all the S-Class, or the ranked strongest, heroes, and proceeds to continue his 'monstrification' process during the battles. Finally he encounters Saitama(Who had come annoyed at the noise from the fight), whose attitude and strength infuriates and eventually destroys Garo's will, then reveals his vision for the future. Saitama, out of character, understands his pain, and under the threat by the defeated heroes to kill Garo, Garo leaves before anyone can catch him.
